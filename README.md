# Archetypum

## About Us

**Archetypum** is a non-profit organization focused on creating and distributing free and open-source software with a strong emphasis on **security**, **stability**, and **user privacy**. Founded in `$DATE`, we’ve been working passionately to support the ideals of digital freedom and autonomy.

## History

Archetypum began in 2022 as a personal hobby project by **Kinderfeld** (CEO), originally under the name **Alvanetics**, and later **F.E.A.R**. As the vision grew, so did the team.

With the help of dedicated collaborators such as **WretchOfLights (WOL)**, **Wazups**, and **VOL.10** with **Marvin Marvelous** (who later departed), the organization began developing foundational tools and libraries like **theSuffocater** and **TheUnixManager**'s.

## Projects

### Prototypes
- [`PrototypeNetBSD`](https://github.com/Archetypum/PrototypeNetBSD) — Firewall/Samba/User configuration scripts bundle for the **NetBSD** operating system.

### Server Utilities
- [`theSuffocater`](https://github.com/Archetypum/theSuffocater) — A security-focused toolset aimed at hardening UNIX-like systems, written in **Python3**.

### Libraries

`TheUnixManager` (tum) — A modular library designed for building easy-to-read crossplatform scripts for UNIX-like systems, written in five languages:

- [`tum-python`](https://github.com/Archetypum/tum-python) WIP
- [`tum-bash`](https://github.com/Archetypum/tum-bash)
- [`tum-perl`](https://github.com/Archetypum/tum-perl)
- [`tum-raku`](https://github.com/Archetypum/tum-raku) WIP
- [`tum-lua`](https://github.com/Archetypum/tum-lua) WIP
- [`tum-c`](https://github.com/Archetypum/tum-c) WIP
- [`tum-rust`](https://github.com/Archetypum/tum-rust) WIP

## Goals

1. Promote the free software movement.
2. Build a nachos factory.
3. Build a second nachos factory.
4. Develop even more projects.
5. Never become evil.
6. Never remove number 5.

> Our future? We don’t know yet — and that’s exciting.
